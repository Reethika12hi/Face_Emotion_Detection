# 😊 Face Emotion Detection using Deep Learning & OpenCV

A **real-time Face Emotion Detection system** that analyzes human facial expressions from images and live webcam video using **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** techniques.

This project detects **multiple faces simultaneously**, predicts their emotions, and displays results in real time with bounding boxes, emotion labels, and a live emotion count summary.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Face Emotion Detection plays a crucial role in **Human–Computer Interaction**, **Mental Health Monitoring**, and **User Behavior Analysis**.

This application leverages:
- **OpenCV** for face detection and video processing  
- **DeepFace**, a pre-trained deep learning framework, for accurate emotion classification  

Supported emotions:
> 😄 Happy | 😢 Sad | 😠 Angry | 😲 Surprise | 😨 Fear | 🤢 Disgust | 😐 Neutral
